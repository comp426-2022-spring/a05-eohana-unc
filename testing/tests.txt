So I want the test to first:
open server
test that the output is correct
run client tests (curl)


Server session:
description
test name
run command (node server.js [args])
expected result


for each server test, there can be many client tests:
client tests would have:
command (curl [args] [other stuff?])
expected result


can i get the server and client under one testing function?

need:
command
args
fork?
tests
